Perhaps I have not been jaded by corporate processes and can bring a fresh perspective. Also means I am not going to shy away from the grunt work of marketing.\nIt’s hard to gain the perspective that I have if you have not been in and around the AI engineer space for the last few years.\nTo prepare for this position, I conducted a 45 minute audit of all of the online properties for AI Engineer Events, and these slides are what happened as a result. These slides are my notes as a result."

I have already expierienced the events ability to bring the smartest minds together and don’t need to be sold on the value of in person experiences.\nI personally already experienced the event’s ability to bring the smartest minds together, and I don’t need to be sold on the value of in-person experiences. So I think me being a master builder for AIE is a real thing."

So this position breaks that cycle, letting me focus on the AI space that I’m already obsessed with.\nAnd then there’s also an AIE pattern where an amazing event happens… The part of the community that is not exactly plugged into the Latent Space ecosystem, that part of the community fizzles out.
